MAPDL and DPF workflow
======================

This example demonstrates consecutive sub modeling using PyMAPDL and PyDPF. The DPF framework
interpolates global model displacements and transfers them as boundary conditions to the local
model, enabling efficient globalâ€“local coupling with the MAPDL pool.
