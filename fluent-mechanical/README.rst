Fluent and mechanical heat transfer workflow for exhaust manifold
=================================================================

This workflow demonstrates the typical solver setup involved in performing a CFD
simulation for the conjugate heat transfer (CHT) analysis of an exhaust manifold
using Ansys Fluent and followed by Thermo-Mechanical analysis  using
Ansys Mechanical.
