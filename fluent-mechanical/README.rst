Geometry, mechanical and post-processing
========================================

This workflow demonstrates how to create a printed circuit board (PCB) geometry, mesh,
run steady state and transient thermal analysis, and post-process using DPF. The geometry
generated is a simple PCB with multiple chips. The exported CAD file (PMDB format) is then
imported inside Ansys Mechanical to run a steady-state thermal analysis followed by transient
analysis.
