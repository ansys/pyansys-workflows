Geometry, meshing and fluids workflow
=====================================

Below is an example of a workflow that demonstrates how to create a geometry, mesh it, and run a
fluid simulation using PyAnsys. The geometry generated is a NACA airfoil, which is prepared for a fluid
simulation. The exported CAD file is then consumed by Ansys Fluent to run a compressible flow simulation
over the airfoil.
