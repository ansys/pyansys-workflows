Maxwell 2D and Lumerical
========================

Surface electrodes adjacent to grating couplers render an integrated ion trap.
In this workflow surface electrodes are modeled using ANSYS Maxwell and grating couplers using
ANSYS Lumerical. ANSYS Maxwell electrostatic solver, based on the finite element method, allows to
evaluate the ion trap height.Then the coordinates of the ion trap are passed to an optimization
algorithm to define the optimal two dimensional grating coupler design, which will focus the laser
beam at the ion trap height.

This workflow is explained in detail in this article:
