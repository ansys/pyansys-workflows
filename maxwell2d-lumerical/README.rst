Maxwell2D and Lumerical
=======================

Surface electrodes adjacent to grating couplers render an integrated ion trap. In this
workflow we model surface electrodes using ANSYS Maxwell and grating couplers using
ANSYS Lumerical.ANSYS Maxwell finite element method electrostatic solver allows to
evaluate the the ion trap height.Then the coordinates of the ion trap are passed to an optimization
algorithm to define the optimal two dimensional grating coupler design, which will focus the laser
beam at the ion trap height.
