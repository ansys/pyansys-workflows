Maxwell2D and Lumerical
=======================

Surface electrodes adjacent to grating couplers render an integrated ion trap. In this
workflow we model surface electrodes using ANSYS Maxwell and grating couplers using
ANSYS Lumerical. Using ANSYS Maxwell's finite element method electrostatic solver, we
evaluate the ion trap height. Then the coordinates of the ion trap are passed to an optimization
algorithm to define the optimal two dimensional grating coupler design, which will focus the laser
beam at the ion trap height.

This workflow is explained in detail in this article:
