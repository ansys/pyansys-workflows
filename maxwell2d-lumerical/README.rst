Maxwell 2D and Lumerical
========================

Surface electrodes adjacent to grating couplers render an integrated ion trap.
This workflow uses Ansys Maxwell to model surface electrodes and Ansys Lumerical to model grating couplers. Using the finite element method, the Maxwell electrostatic solver evaluates the ion trap height. The workflow then passes the coordinates of the ion trap to an optimization
algorithm to define the optimal two-dimensional grating coupler design, which focuses the laser
beam at the ion trap height.

This workflow is explained in detail in this article:
